Added more unit tests
Fixed a bug in `doc_centrality` using the `centroid` method


# text2map 0.1.8

Fixes for changes to the Matrix package

# text2map 0.1.6.9003

Fix encoding issue for non-ASCII characters to work with `fastmatch`
Add functionality 
- `perm_tester` for Monte Carlo Permutation Tests for Model P-Values
- `rancor_builder` creates random corpus based on provided term probabilities 
- `rancors_builder` creates multiple random corpora]

Include additional tests, updated documentation and vignettes

# text2map 0.1.6.9001

Working on an encoding error in `fastmatch` which shows inconsistent behavior with non-ASCII characters. This dev version provides a temporary fix.

# text2map 0.1.6
## Improvements

- Add functionality
  - `doc_centrality` calculates four graph-based centrality metrics using DTMs
  - `doc_similarty` calculates four document similarity measures using DTMs


# text2map 0.1.5
## Improvements

- Replaced dependency
  - using ClusterR for `get_regions`, instead of mlpack
  - Uses the Armadillo library k-means algorithm only (no longer provides an option)
- Added functionality:
  - `seq_builder` creates a token-integer sequence representation
- Added Shakespeare metadata for examples
- Import Matrix package methods

# text2map 0.1.4

## Improvements

* Added functionality
    - `dtm_builder` includes an option to return a dense base R matrix
    - `dtm_stopper` includes an option to remove based on a terms rank (e.g., top 10), stopping based on count and proportion are now two separate options

# text2map 0.1.3

## Improvements

* Add functions:
    - `find_transformation()` to norm, center, and align matrices
    - `find_projection()` finds the projection matrix onto a vector
    - `find_rejection()` finds the rejection matrix away from a vector
    - `dtm_melter()` quickly turns a DTM into a triplet dataframe (doc_id, term, count)
* Fixed `get_centroid()` naming (limits to single word for names)

# text2map 0.1.1

## Improvements

* Added functionality to `dtm_stopper()` to stop words by document or term frequencies
    * Nomenclature was changed, `stop_freq` was changed to `stop_termfreq`
* Added functionality to `dtm_resampler()` to resample proportion and fixed N lengths
* Added and clarified documentation
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
